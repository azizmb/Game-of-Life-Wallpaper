Python script to generate evolving wallpapers for Ubuntu that mutate based on the rules of Conways Game of Life. Comments and suggestions welcome.

REQUIREMENTS:
python
PIL
numpy

Instructions:
- Load the initial cell pattern in test.lif or in any other file (change the path in the config appropriately). 
- The file must be a LIF 1.06 file.
- Change the resolution in config.py to the resolution of your screen, change the paths to appropriate paths on your computer and change any other settings you may want to.
- Run gol.py
- Set the generated xml as your wallpaper.


This is still a very rough implementation, needs lots of cleanup and tuning. My first time doing anything in image processing/numpy so some things may be very inefficient.

The implementation of the Game of Life Simulation was taken mostly take from Dhananjay Nene's talk at inpycon2010

The function to calculate Eucledian Distance Transform was taken from here:

TO-DO:
- Write a parser for .lif files so loading of initial cell configuration becomes easier.
- Figure out how to amplify the colour variations
